# Zesty Souffle ü•ê

Welcome to Zesty Souffle! Are you craving junk food but not sure what you want to eat? I have been there far too many times. I created this application to help those like me overcome that challenge. This application allows you to find menus for restaurants located within the University of Waterloo food plaza. Users can compare, filter, and view restaurants and their menu items. You can access it here: https://zesty-souffle.netlify.app/ 

## Features: 
* New and updated featured restaurant displayed on home page
* Find restaurants by categories
* Compare restaurants and their menu items side by side
* I'm feeling lucky feature to help you find new restaurants
* Search by food or restaurant
